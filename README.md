Hey I'm Crystal. I'm passionate about creating. I'm an artist, by nature. Python excites me! Problem solving gives me life. I'm studying to be a Data Scientist, and hope to specialize in Machine Learning. I'd love to eventually teach others about what I learn as well. Watch this space to see how this garden grows!
